# Contributing Guidelines

## Development Workflow
1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/feature-name`
2. Make your changes with daily commits
3. Ensure code passes linting and tests
4. Create a Pull Request to `main` branch
5. Wait for approval before merging

## Commit Standards
- Write commit messages in English
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

## Code Review Process
1. All PRs require at least 1 approval
2. Address all review comments before merging
3. Ensure all checks pass (lint, tests)

## Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for new features
- Update tests when modifying existing code
- Ensure no breaking changes without discussion
